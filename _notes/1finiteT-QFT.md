This is the lecture note I wrote for MIT's quantum field theory III (8.325) final presentation. In this note, I briefly summarized the Matsubara formalism of finite temperature field theory and introduced applications mainly using scalar fields. By doing so, I bridged some gaps between finite temperature field theory and classical statistical mechanics, and showed how to obtain some neat, well known results of stat mech from the field theory approach.
