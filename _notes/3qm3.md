These are the notes I perpared to bring to MIT's quantum physics III (8.06) final exam (yes the exam is open notes, up to 4 pieces of double sided A4 paper). These notes are meant to be a compilation of important formulae that a student should understand the physical meaning of but not necessarily memorize. In my case I included everything I was afraid of missing a sign, a factor of $i$, 2, $\pi$, or an $\hbar$ etc. on, which accidentally made this sheet almost too comprehensive.
