As an undergraduate student in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I am interested in quantum field theory. In particular, I am drawn to the elegance of effective field theories and the power of geometry.

Perviously, I worked in the LHCb group of MIT for two semesters. The projects equipped me with valuable experience in applying machine learning algorithms to the study of rare $B$ meson decays. During this work, I successfully extracted the branching fraction of the $ B^+ \to K^+ J/\psi \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay and identified the process $ B^+ \to K^+ \eta_c \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^- $. This experience has driven me to explore theoretical methods used to study interactions, which leads to my interest in quantum field theory.

Additionally, I participated in the International Physics Olympiad and Asian Physics Olympiad representing Taiwan. I came in 11th in the 2022 International Physics Olypiad organized Switzerland. After competeing in IPhO, I started giving talks for high schoolers and tutoring to promote physics by making connections between high school physics and university physics through original lectures and problem-solving. 

In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, cooking, and speedcubing. I also enjoy constantly learning new things about different traditions and languages.
