I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am interested in theoretical nuclear and particle physics, in particular, I am drawn to the predictive power of various phenomenological descriptions including effective field theories and holography.

As of Spring 2026, I am working on a project predicting jet substructure modification from heavy ion collisions using the strong/weak (pQCD+holography) hybrid model. I work closely with  Arjun Kudinoor, Prof. Krishna Rajagopal, and Prof. Daniel Pablos. We will be putting out energy correlator predictions for oxygen-oxygen collisions at the LHC, through which we will analyze how soft energy loss and hard scattering depend on the properties of the quark gluon plasma and modify the jets. From June - August 2025, I worked on a project at Technische Universität München (TUM), with Tom Magorsch and Prof. Nora Brambilla. This project is centered around improving the theoretical descriptions and numerical simulations of heavy quarkonia decay using the open quantum system + pNRQCD framework. We are still finalizing the project and discussing how we want to present the final results and I am quite excited.

Before coming to MIT, I participated in the International Physics Olympiad and Asian Physics Olympiad as a representive of Taiwan. I came in 11th in the 2022 International Physics Olympiad. After competeing in IPhO, I started tutoring high school students to promote physics learning through a problem-solving based approach. As a continuation of such effort, I joined the MIT physics mentorship program in Spring 2025, and advised 6 students who were attending the first year electromagnetism classes (8.02 and 8.022). I plan to stay as a part of the mentorship program to assist more students with understanding physics concepts and navigating the Institute, as well as become a useful resource for less experienced mentors. 

In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, cooking, reading, and occasionally speedcubing. I am a setter at the MIT men's volleyball club, a proud fried chicken/mushroom chef at the MIT Association of Taiwanese Students, and a slow braised dishes enjoyer. I also enjoy learning new things about different cultural traditions and languages. I speak Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien (a.k.a Taiwanese/Taiwan Minanese) as a native speaker, English is the main language I use in professional settings, and I have been learning German for roughly one year.
