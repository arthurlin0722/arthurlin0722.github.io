As a second year undergraduate student in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I am interested in quantum field theory. In particular, I am drawn to the predictive power of effective field theories and the elegance of algebra and geometry.

As of summer 2025, I am currently conducting a research internship at TUM department of physics in Prof. Nora Brambilla's group. I am also working on a project at MIT center for theoretical physics under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao.

In 2024, I worked in the LHCb group of MIT for two semesters, the projects equipped me with valuable experience in applying machine learning algorithms to the study of rare $B$ meson decays. During this work, I successfully extracted the branching fraction of the $ B^+ \to K^+ J/\psi \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay and identified the process $ B^+ \to K^+ \eta_c \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^- $. This experience drove me to explore theoretical methods used to study interactions, which leads to my interest in quantum field theory.

Before coming to MIT, I participated in the International Physics Olympiad and Asian Physics Olympiad as a representive of Taiwan. I came in 11th in the 2022 International Physics Olympiad organized in Switzerland. After competeing in IPhO, I started giving talks for high schoolers and tutoring to promote physics by making connections between high school physics and university physics through a problem-solving based approach. 

In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, cooking, and speedcubing. I also enjoy learning new things about different cultural traditions and languages.
