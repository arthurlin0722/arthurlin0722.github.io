As a second year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), I am deeply interested in research on quantum field theory. In particular, I am drawn to the predictive power that effective field theories possess and the elegance of describing quantum field theories in an algebraic framework.

As of summer 2025, I am conducting a research internship at Technische Universität München (TUM) department of physics in Prof. Nora Brambilla's group, under supervision of Tom Magorsch. The project we are working on is centered around improving the theoretical descriptions and numerical simulation of heavy quarkonia decays using an open quantum system framework. I am also working on a project calculating symmetric sectors of a spin chain at MIT center for theoretical physics under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao. 

In 2024, I worked in the LHCb group of MIT for two semesters, the projects equipped me with valuable experience in applying machine learning algorithms to the study of rare $B$ meson decays. During this work, I successfully extracted the branching fraction of the $ B^+ \to K^+ J/\psi \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay and identified the process $ B^+ \to K^+ \eta_c \to K^+ \eta \pi^+ \pi^- $. This experience drove me to explore theoretical methods used to study interactions, which leads to my interest in quantum field theory.

Before coming to MIT, I participated in the International Physics Olympiad and Asian Physics Olympiad as a representive of Taiwan. I came in 11th in the 2022 International Physics Olympiad organized in Switzerland. After competeing in IPhO, I started tutoring high school students to promote physics by making connections between high school physics and more advanced concepts through a problem-solving based approach. 

In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, cooking, and speedcubing. I am a setter at MIT's men's volleyball club, a proud fried chicken/mushroom chef at the MIT Association of Taiwanese Students, and a slow braised dishes enjoyer. I also enjoy learning new things about different cultural traditions and languages.
