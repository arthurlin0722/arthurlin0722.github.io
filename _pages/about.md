I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and I am interested in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. In particular, I am drawn to the predictive power of various phenomenological descriptions including effective field theories and holography, as well as and the elegance of describing quantum field theories in an algebraic framework.

As of Fall 2025, I am back at MIT, working on a project prediction jet substructure observables from heavy ion collisiosn using the pQCD+holography hybrid model in Prof. Krishna Rajagopal's group under supervision of Arjun Kudinoor. From June - August 2025, I worked on a research internship at Technische Universität München (TUM) department of physics in Prof. Nora Brambilla's group under supervision of Tom Magorsch. The project we worked on is centered around improving the theoretical descriptions and numerical simulation of heavy quarkonia decay using the open quantum system + pNRQCD framework. We are still finalizing the project and discussing how we want to present the final results and I am quite excited.

On top of these, I worked on a project calculating symmetric sectors of a spin chain at MIT center for theoretical physics under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao in the 2025 Spring semester and a project in the LHCb group on machine learning approach to branching fraction extraction for the Sping and Summer semesters in 2024. Both projects equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that I still use.  

Before coming to MIT, I participated in the International Physics Olympiad and Asian Physics Olympiad as a representive of Taiwan. I came in 11th in the 2022 International Physics Olympiad organized in Switzerland. After competeing in IPhO, I started tutoring high school students to promote physics by making connections between high school physics and more advanced concepts through a problem-solving based approach. 

In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, cooking, and speedcubing. I am a setter at the MIT men's volleyball club, a proud fried chicken/mushroom chef at the MIT Association of Taiwanese Students, and a slow braised dishes enjoyer. I also enjoy learning new things about different cultural traditions and languages.
