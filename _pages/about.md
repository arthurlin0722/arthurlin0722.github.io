I am student from Taiwan pursueing Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Mathematics in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently, my interest falls in nuclear and particle physics, my most recent research project involves data analysis for an LHCb experiment on the $$B_C^+ \to J/\psi \mu\nu$$ decay. In high school, I participated in IPhO 2022, the preparation for which sparked my interest in physics. In my spare time, I enjoy speedcubing and volleyball.
