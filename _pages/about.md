I am student from Taiwan pursueing Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Mathematics in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently, my interest falls in nuclear and particle physics, in particular, I enjoy learning about the theory that describes are universe. 

I am currently doing undergraduate research in Professor Michael William's group under Doctor Blaise Delaney. My most recent research project involves data analysis for the LHCb experiments on the $B_c^+ \to D^0 \mu\nu$ decay. 

In high school, I participated in APhO 2021, APhO 2022, and IPhO 2022, the preparation for which sparked my interest in physics and introduced me to undergraduate physics and basic concepts in experiments. In my spare time, I enjoy speedcubing and volleyball.
