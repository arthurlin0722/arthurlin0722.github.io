## Overview
I am interested in theoretical nuclear and particle physics, especially non-perturabtive methods in quantum field theories that lead to profound connections between different disciplines in physics, mathematics, and other sciences. In particular, I find non-perturbative phenomenons that arise in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) particularly intriguing, and that they often lead to surprising and exciting discoveries. On the practical aspect, I've enjoyed working on hard probes of the quark gluon plasma (QGP), applying phenomenological models such as effective field theories and the AdS/CFT dualituy to provide pre/postdictions of measurements in heavy ion collisions. 

## Jet substructure modification 
Since Fall 2025, I have been working on a project predicting jet substructure modification in quark gluon plasma formed in heavy- and light-ion collisions. In this project, I work closely with Prof. Krishna Rajagopal's, Arjun Kudinoor, and Prof. Daniel Pablos, employing the strong/weak coupling model (Hybrid Model) of jet quenching and performing jet observable calculations. We analyze how energy loss, jet-induced wake, and hard Molière scattering modify jet observables such as the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the Soft Drop angle $R_g$, and the energy correlators. In particular, I am responsible for calculating two point energy-energy correlators (EECs) of jets formed in oxygen-oxygen collisions at the LHC. Through these cacalculations, we provide a compelling channel through which Molière scattering in the QGP can be studied and jet substructure modification in the QGP can be interpreted. 

## Quarkonia suppression
Since June 2025, I have been studying heavy quarkonia decay in the QGP with Prof. Nora Brambilla and Tom Magorsch at Technische Universität München (TUM). In the past, open quantum systems and potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) were combined to derive a set of Redfield master equations of quarkonia dynamics. By exploiting temperature and energy hierearchies in the QGP, the Redfield master equations can be expanded to a Lindblad form, projected to radial space, and solved numerically. In this project, we work on implementing a novel numerical approach to relax the binding energy over temperature expansion, hoping to capture quarkonia dynamics in the QGP better. In our work, we explored a more elegant description of present the projection to radial space while utilizing unitary equivalence of quantum operations. We then combined both theoretical motivations and lattice QCD data to improve the previous paramatrizations. Tom also inspired me to think about possible ways to apply quantum computing and neural networks in high energy physics, but that will be saved for the future. 

# Others
In addition to the aforementioned, I worked on a project calculating symmetric sectors of spin chains and relating them to the Jone's polynomials under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao in the 2025 Spring semester and another project in the LHCb group on machine learning approach to branching fraction extraction of rare beauty decay for the Spring and Summer semesters in 2024. Both projects equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that I still use.
