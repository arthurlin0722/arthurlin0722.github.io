# Overview
On a broader scope, I am interested in theoretical nuclear and particle physics, especially non-perturabtive methods in QFT that can lead to profound connections between different subfields in physics, mathematics, and other sciences. On a narrower scope, I am drawn to the predictive power of various phenomenological models of QCD including effective field theories and holography, as well as and the elegance of describing quantum field theories in an algebraic framework. On the practical aspect, the projects I've enjoyed working on the most are related to hard probes of the quark gluon plasma (QGP). 

# Jet substructure modification 
Since Fall 2025, I have been working on a project predicting jet substructure modification in quark gluon plasma formed in heavy- and light-ion collisions. In this project, I work closely withProf. Krishna Rajagopal's group, Arjun Kudinoor, and Prof. Daniel Pablos, employing the strong/weak coupling model (Hybrid Model) of jet quenching and performing jet observable calculations. We analyze how energy loss, jet-induced wake, and hard Molière scattering modify jet observables such as the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the Soft Drop angle $R_g$, and the energy correlators. In particular, I am responsible for calculating two point energy-energy correlators (EECs) of jets formed in oxygen-oxygen collisions at the LHC. Through these cacalculations, we provide a compelling channel through which Molière scattering in the QGP can be studied. 

# Quarkonia suppression
Since June 2025, I have been studying heavy quarkonia decay in the QGP with Prof. Nora Brambilla and Tom Magorsch at Technische Universität München (TUM). In the past, open quantum systems and potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) were combined to derive a set of Redfield master equations of quarkonia dynamics. By exploiting temperatur and energy hierearchies in the QGP, the Redfield master equations can be expanded to a Lindblad form, and by applying isotropy, the Lindblad equation can be projected to radial space and solved numerically. In this project, we work on implementing a novel numerical approach to relax the binding energy over temperature expansion, hoping to capture quarkonia dynamics in QGP better. During the project, we explored a more elegant way to present the projection to radial space, and discussed in detail the unitary equivalence of quantum operations. We are still finalizing the project and discussing how to present the final results, and I am quite excited. This project also got me into thinking possible ways to apply quantum computing and neural networks in high energy physics, but that will be saved for the future. 

# Others
In addition to the aforementioned, I worked on a project calculating symmetric sectors of spin chains and realting them to the Jone's polynomials under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao in the 2025 Spring semester and another project in the LHCb group on machine learning approach to branching fraction extraction of rare beauty decay for the Spring and Summer semesters in 2024. Both projects equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that I still use.
