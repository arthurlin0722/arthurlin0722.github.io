##Overview##
I am interested in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. In particular, I am drawn to the predictive power of various phenomenological descriptions including effective field theories and holography, as well as and the elegance of describing quantum field theories in an algebraic framework.

As of Fall 2025, I am back at MIT, working on a project predicting jet substructure modification from heavy ion collisions using the strong/weak (pQCD+holography) hybrid model in Prof. Krishna Rajagopal's group, under supervision of Arjun Kudinoor. We will be putting out energy correlator predictions for oxygen-oxygen collisions at the LHC, through which we will analyze how substructure modification mechanisms such as soft energy loss and hard scattering depend on the size of the quark gluon plasma. From June - August 2025, I worked on a research internship at Technische Universität München (TUM) Fakultät für Physik, in Prof. Nora Brambilla's group, under supervision of Tom Magorsch. The project we worked on is centered around improving the theoretical descriptions and numerical simulations of heavy quarkonia decay using the open quantum system + pNRQCD framework. We are still finalizing the project and discussing how we want to present the final results and I am quite excited.

In addition to the aforementioned, I worked on a project calculating symmetric sectors of a spin chain at MIT center for theoretical physics under Prof. Shu-Heng Shao in the 2025 Spring semester and a project in the LHCb group on machine learning approach to branching fraction extraction of rare beauty decay for the Spring and Summer semesters in 2024. Both projects equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that I still use.
